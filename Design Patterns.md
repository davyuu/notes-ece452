Decorator
	Wraps an object to provide new bahviour
State
	Encapsulates state-based behaviors and uses delegation to switch between them
Iterator
	Provides a way to traverse a collection of objects without exposing its implementation
Facade
	Simplifies interface of a set of classes
Stategy
	Encapsulates interchangeable behaviors and uses delegation to decide which one to use
Proxy
	Wraps an object to control access to it
Factory Method
	Subclasses decide which concrete calsses to create
Adapter
	Wraps an object and provides a different interface
Observer
	Allows objects to be notified when state changes
Template Method
	Subclasses decide how to implement steps steps in an algo
Composite
	Clients treat collections of objects and individual objects uniformly
Singleton
	Ensures one and only one object is created
Abstract Factory
	Allows client to create families of objects without specifying their concrete classes
Command
	Encapsulates request as an object
