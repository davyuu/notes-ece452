## Design process
- requirements
	- waht has to be accomplished
- architecture
	- vision as to how the requirements can be best realized
	- framework for how best to implement
- detailed design
	- getting each piece of the puzzle the right shape
	- fitting it with other pieces

## Requirement vs Design
- Rqeuirements first
	- decide what want before design
	- reduce risk
- Arch & design
	- risky if no clear idea of objective
	- can help clarify objective

## Goals of software development
- need to understand requirements
- want software with max functionality
- code must be reliable
- cost to develop and maintain is important
- want results as fast as possible
- must minimize development risks
- do no harm

## Software engineering
- indentify desired funcionality
- plan/cost activities
- develop architectural design
- monitor progress
- document decision points
- identify problems ASAP
- test exhaustively
- constantly collaborate with stake holders

## Acid tests
- which of the developmen goals are more achievable using engineering principals
- can software development be a set of well defined manageable discrete logical steps
- when is a picture/design/essay worth 1000 lines of code

## The Bricklayer
- small fixes can lead to bigger problems
	- small fix only requires few bricks
	- understand what might go wrong
	- know how to undo what is ever done
	- never cast off the line

### Challenges in creating conceptual design
- Porconceptions
- personal bias
- different points of view
- give and/or take between team members
- leadership, steering, different diretions, goal

## Taxonomy
- what is software to DO
	- Functional
	- Binary behaviour (does or doesnt do it)
	- Determined by specific code in one plcace
- what is software to BE
	- Non functional
	- Spectrum of behaviour (bettwe or worse)
	- Dtermined by code across the system
	- Emergent property consequent of design choices

## NFPs
- NFPs are constraints on the manner in which the system implements and delivers its functionality
	- Efficiency
	- Complexity
	- Scalability
	- Heterogeneity
	- Adatability
	- Security
	- Dependability

## FP vs NFP
- products are sold based on their FPs
	- cellphones, cars, tents
- NFPs play a critical role in perception
	- program keeps crashing
	- it doesnt work with my ...
	- its too slow

## Non-functional requirements
- technical constraints: restrictions made for technical reasons
- Business constaints: restrictions made for business reasons
- Quality attributes: scalabliity, secruty, performance, maintainability, evolvability, reliability, dependability deployability,
- Focus on architectural level
	- Components
	- Connectors
	- Topologies

- requirements about the quality of a deliverable
	- __Quality__ requirements
- Architectural choice largely driven by
	- __Trade off__ between quality requirements
- Quality requiremnets
	- __Driven__ by needs of system

### Non-functional Quality requirements
- For operations
	- Availability (doesnt fail; MTBF; MTTR)
	- Portability (can be run of most/all platforms)
	- Deployability (installing, uninstalling, provisioning)
	- Security (authorisation, vulnerability)
- When executing
	- Performance (speed of solution)
	- Throughput (response times; latency)
	- Scalability (load, connections, sizes increase)
- For developers
	- Simplicity/Readability (design easy to understand)
	- Testability (can be easity tests; fixed; logs)
	- Maintainability (can be easily changed)
- For architects
	- Integratability (with other softwares)
	- Extensibility (Plug ins)
	- Flexibility (Many ways of being used)
	- Product lines (Many ways of being created)
- Users
	- Usefulness (does it solve a problem)
	- Usability (ergonomics; efficiency; atractiveness)
	- Trustability (confidence that not malicious)
- Software Providers
	- Risk (failure to deliver; risk of being sued)
	- Budget (cost to develop; risk of overruns)
	- Novelty (can it be sold; to how many)
	- Profit (benefit to company; justification)

# Software Project Planning

## Project Manager
- abliity to allocate resources to tasks effectively, so tasks are completed on schedule
- courage to estimate when the future is cloudy
- someone who knows what will go wrong before it does
- someone who ensures crisis do not happen

## Project Proposal
- good idea, clearly described, implementable
- plan
	- actions
	- schedule
	- people
	- budget
- becomes conceptual design

## Project Status Report
- motivational
- forces regular review of progress
- provides early warning of problems
- shows extent of schedule
- gives historic record of overall development
- communicates to outside stake holders
