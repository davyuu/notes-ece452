## Why is design needed
- hardest part of design is deciding what to design
- needed t ocommunicate high level ideas
- is backbone of implementation
- provides overarching top down view
- implementation is bottom up
- design considerations get overlooked

## Rationalism vs Empiricalism
- can sufficient thought alone design a complex object correctly
- Rationalist say yes
	- belive can become perfect
	- concern is how to become perfect
- Empiritcalist say no
	- inherently flawed and subject to error
	- perfection is out of price range
	- concern is how to compensate for this
- Rationalist example
	- everything has been composed, just not yet written down [Mozart]
- Empiricist
	- design involved implementing
	- imcompleteness and inconsistency only becomes clear during implementation
	- what extent should be design specs be written

## Structured development
- waterfall model
	- how we think things should be done
	- appeals to prior prejudice
- search for better approaches
	- waterlofall approach fails in practise
	- how do good designers actually do things

- Co-evolution
	- structured sequence of better and protoyypes
	- early modelling reduces risk
- Open source
	- chaotic see a need to solve it
- Agile development
	- Focus on communication

### Design aim
- to translate requiremtns into deliverable
- uncovering requirements
- recognising options
