# Outline

## Intro (1h)
- Why design
- Input, output and constraints of deisng process
- Types of desing
- relationship to software quality and evolution
- design in more mature implementation technologies

## Software Design Process Models (3h)
- Design as search
- Design spaces
- Design state, goal structure, generative design operations, early quantitative evaluations, control of design process
- basic models of design
	- transformational, plan/architecture driven
- relationship to other lifecycle activities

## Arch/Design Representations (9h)
- What should be represented (structure, behaviour)
- Informal represenation of design, examples of design notation
- formal rep of design
- domain specific arch descriptions
- role of standards, reference arch
- Design documentation

## Design Plans/Arch (9h)
- Review of small/medium sacle plans (data strcuture, programming language stcutures, concurrency)
- plans/arch for common types of software systems
	- translators, embedded, realteim, user interface

## Design Strategies and Methods (6h)
- Design strategies
- selected methosd: object modelling techique, structued deisng, real time, user interfaces
- Methods for design with off the shelf compoennts

## Design Assessment (3h)
- assessment of deimensions and factors afecting relative importance.
- desing tradeoffs
- evolability/understandability criteria
- design complexity metrics
- asessment strategies
	- analytical, simulation, rapid protyping, example: response time/throughput estimation

## Design Verification (3h)
- Design reveiws, scenarios, test cases
- testing of executable design reps
- verification of properties
